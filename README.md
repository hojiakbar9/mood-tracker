# Mood Tracker Console App
A simple Java console application for tracking daily moods.

## 📌 Overview
This project is a mini Java console-based application designed to help users track their moods. It allows adding, editing, deleting, searching, listing, and exporting mood records. The entire project was built as part of a final assignment consisting of multiple tasks.

The application uses:
- **Classes & Objects**
- **ArrayList** for storing mood entries
- **Scanner** for user input
- **Exception handling** for validation
- **File I/O** for writing mood logs to a file

## 🚀 Features
- Add a new mood with date, time, and notes
- Validate duplicate moods (no two moods can have the same date & time)
- Edit mood notes
- Delete moods (by date or by complete details)
- Search moods (by date or by complete details)
- Display all moods
- Export all moods to a file (`moodtracker.txt`)
